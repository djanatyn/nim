lab report - jonathan strickland
================================

*The following is the lab report I submitted for the project. The code is pretty useless, just something I had to do for class and very messy. Eww.*

* During this lab, I learned how to use the Random class, and I learned that it's important to come up with a general structure to your program before you start coding. I also learned a few Java idioms. The most difficult part of the assignment was starting from the beginning and wondering what to add first, and the easiest part was fixing all the small quirks at the end.
* I did not attempt any "above and beyond" tasks (unless you count submitting the assignment as going "above and beyond").
* I tested my game by running the code a few times, trying different strategies, passing off the code to my friends to try, and trying to outsmart my own code. I did things like entering negative values, and entering strings when an integer was expected. Most of these issues, I fixed.
* I did not add comments to my project. Too lazy, and I don't want to look at the code anymore. I don't really have time, anyway.
* To extend the functionality of my game, I could try refactoring or just throw it away and start over. The latter would probably be a better option - it's a mess, and doesn't really have a coherent structure at all. You could add more classes if you want, I guess.
* Compile all of the files, and run Nim.java. You should know that entering strings when it prompts you for the amount of marbles to take away will crash the game, and that this there are no comments, so beware.
